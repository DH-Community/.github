# Welcome to the Developers Home Community

A GitHub organization that allows developers to talk about everything about development. Of course, more than that, it is also a developing internal development community.

## How do I join?

This page is the public README for a private developers community. We’ve made it private to enable a free exchange of ideas, and we’re starting with a small group to ensure a good experience.

Create an issue [here](https://github.com/DH-Community/Apply) to apply for membership.
